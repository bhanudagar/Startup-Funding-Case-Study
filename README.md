# Case Study 1
In case study 1, we have quite simple scenarios based on different situations that a startup would face while finding an investor.

# Case Study 2
Case study 2 contains much more detailed analysis of the dataset. 
In this case study, I have taken real world scenarios. 

I have first analysed the dataset based on the location. 
If location does not work, then I have analysed the dataset further on the basis of Investors who have invested most number of times. 

But now, there can be a case when the invesrtor has invested in the same startup multiple times, so I filtered the investor who has invested the most in different startups.

After all this, I further filtered the results on the basis of types of Funding (Crowd funding, seed funding etc.,).

Now, finally, I found out the top 5 investors who have invested in different startups and whose best-suited investment type is Private Equity.
